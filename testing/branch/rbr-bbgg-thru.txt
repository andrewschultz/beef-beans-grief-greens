}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Beef, Beans, Grief, Greens has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.

With the right commands and pacing, you and the lovin' lout move the oven from its former position. The lout, very unloutishly indeed, asks if you need the oven to move anywhere. You defer all "Oh, it'd be too much!" but after some nonsense back-and-forthing, you both realize that's wasted energy. You both move the oven back to Reeve Row pretty quickly. The oven is -- well, you sense it isn't ready to cook anything, but it's a lot easier to repair here.
The lovin' lout waits around, as if they suspect they could help you with one more thing. Very considerate indeed, for a lout!

You and the lovin' lout pull on one, two, THREE! It takes a couple of times, but the rug bursts free from the floor. You see an outline of the passage you believed was there.
You shake hands with the lovin' lout, who exits and nods to wish you the best.
Your kneeling on the floor to pull the rug up gave you a good view inside the oven. There you find something called a goon guide. But you can't use it, because you're too good to be a goon. That's how it works, right? Or maybe not...

Well, it is worth a try. Amazingly, on rereading the goon guide, you find tips on locating lost silverware. You missed it with the first read-through, probably because you weren't focused on finding it.
And here you thought it would just help you fix the oven!
You flip through the goon guide once again. You seem to have gotten the big stuff from it. You tuck it in a safe place behind the oven for reference. You have enough to carry around.

A burly workman named Amped Ox takes you and the downed dork to the Damped Docks, where indeed a small meat moat (heavy meat, light gravy) is discovered. It looks and smells clean. Apparently, it was part of an all-you-can-eat buffet, and the workers ran out of stomach space.

Bri-Bro whispers to you, "So many people demand the house special. I give them something frou-frou, but it's not really what I enjoy cooking. Now I'll have to pretend to kick you out."

Wait! Something about the bee looks funny! Yes, it is not really a bee, but a less aggressive animal in disguise. Just knowing it is a flopper flea makes you less scared. Without fear, your running around gets more strategic, until it gets exhausted chasing you.
It buzzes and mumbles off. You're not surprised that, as it does, it drops a copper key, which you pick up.

You know there will be many stores in the distance. So you begin your trek. On the way you ask the way to Veggie Ville. People are helpful.
Once you get there, you worry you have no money to pay. But when they see the Last Least Fast Feast, they recognize what you are here for. Why, they have just the thing: veggies and fruits of irregular shapes, which get thrown out anyway!

Ah! You had confidence you could find a scrappy scrawl, and you do. The instructions seem to make sense. You need to look to break open a passage where there is none, yet. An unexpectedly hollow place. Apparently, from the scrawl, one that makes a special sort of noise. Not quite a THWIP or a THWUP. So where is the weak spot?

Yes, the Wheat Well could use a Sheet Shell.
Suddenly, with the Sheet Shell in place, ready for a book, you hear your postal delivery person in the distance. You hope to rush to the door, wherever that is. You know if you don't show up, they won't leave any potential package. But how? You need motivation and hustle!

Aaand ... pursuant to general dream/fantasy logic rules, you just make it! But now, what with the Internet taking over with emails, you often forget what your lovable mail carrier's name is! There must be a clue to who they are. As for how they got there, and how they know you're there, you'll just chalk it up to increased efficiency in the postal service due to progress in the ordinary sort of magic that everyone looks down on but would be terribly sorry if it vanished.

True, Leet Lel showed you a lot of things that maybe nobody else would show you. But it was always tied up with Lel pointing out your inadequacies, or your shortcomings, or how you should really have noted in the 1st place, without really showing you how to figure these things out for yourself.
