}$REJECT=I couldn't parse that command. You don't need any more than two words long.
}$REJECT1=Most special commands are more than one word. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT1A=Most special commands are more than one word, because of the rhyme-pairs involved. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$REJECT2=Your rhyming attempts bring up nothing. Or, if you tried a standard verb--well, Bright Brave Knight Knave has eliminated a lot of them, so you can focus on the puzzle verbs. VERBS will give a list of useful, non-puzzle-solving verbs.
}$GREENBONUSFIRST=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green--one of the words you thought must be right. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.
}$GREENBONUS=The HA HALF button on your Leet Learner lights up green. Very dim, though. Perhaps this is a rhyme you don't strictly need to figure to win.

You're already feeling a bit low. You don't need to advertise it, or sink lower.
That has to be really, really close, though! Perhaps a potentially hearty interjection would work better.
How to leave with your head held high, with a forceful word showing you're willing to take on the world?

Note that, because there are three different endings, you'll automatically have "missed" two of them, which I don't want to spoil. You can UNDO to track the others down.
You found everything before the finale, though. Good job!

#the other solution is to raise -h, but in that case, tests run slower.
