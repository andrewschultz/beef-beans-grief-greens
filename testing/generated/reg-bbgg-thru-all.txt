With the right commands and pacing, you and the lovin' lout move the oven from its former position. The lout, very unloutishly indeed, asks if you need the oven to move anywhere. You defer all "Oh, it'd be too much!" but after some nonsense back-and-forthing, you both realize that's wasted energy. You both move the oven back to Reeve Row pretty quickly. The oven is -- well, you sense it isn't ready to cook anything, but it's a lot easier to repair here.
The lovin' lout waits around, as if they suspect they could help you with one more thing. Very considerate indeed, for a lout!

The lovin' lout beams at such a display of strength! You smile back and nod vigorously. Then the lovin' lout claps you on the shoulder, smiles and shakes your hand before leaving.
Your kneeling on the floor to pull the rug up gave you a good view inside the oven. There you find something called a goon guide. But you can't use it, because you're too good to be a goon. That's how it works, right? Or maybe not...

The cray cruel fey fool hands you some surprisingly not-cray gray gruel and snickers before running off. What kind of square would actually LIKE gruel?
But you want to be considerate about allergies, people trying to diet, people with vegan lifestyles, and so forth. It will be useful, you guess, as a base or paste.

The fussed fellow seems relieved to hand you the Jell-O. It may be just Jell-O, but it's all different kinds of colors and flavors. Including pineapple! You remember when some smart-aleck in middle school said pineapple Jell-O would never be a thing. In fact, that smart-aleck snickered when you were chosen for the ceremony.

#testcase-run-vr-potpourri-rule-default
You realize what the smell is. Well, not the specific ingredients. But it has to be potpourri. Where is it leaking from? Following your nose leads you to a large canister. It might be too much for the feast, but it can be used elsewhere -- and maybe even last until the next feast.

Ah! You had confidence you could find a scrappy scrawl, and you do. The instructions seem to make sense. You need to look to break open a passage where there is none, yet. An unexpectedly hollow place. Apparently, from the scrawl, one that makes a special sort of noise. Not quite a THWIP or a THWUP. So where is the weak spot?

A long game of bappy-ball is played. Everyone is exhausted and hungry afterwards. They eat everything that is put in front of them. You doze off, and you are given a vision... one where you are forced to be more, or less, popular than your associate. Yes, "associate" is the right word.

Aaand ... pursuant to general dream/fantasy logic rules, you just make it! But now, what with the Internet taking over with emails, you often forget what your lovable mail carrier's name is! There must be a clue to who they are. As for how they got there, and how they know you're there, you'll just chalk it up to increased efficiency in the postal service due to progress in the ordinary sort of magic that everyone looks down on but would be terribly sorry if it vanished.

True, Leet Lel showed you a lot of things that maybe nobody else would show you. But it was always tied up with Lel pointing out your inadequacies, or your shortcomings, or how you should really have noted in the 1st place, without really showing you how to figure these things out for yourself.
