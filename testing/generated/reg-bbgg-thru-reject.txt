You defer all "Oh, it'd be too much!" but after some nonsense back-and-forthing, you both realize that's wasted energy. You both move the oven back to Reeve Row pretty quickly. The oven is -- well, you sense it isn't ready to cook anything, but it's a lot easier to repair here.

The lovin' lout beams at such a display of strength! You smile back and nod vigorously. Then the lovin' lout claps you on the shoulder, smiles and shakes your hand before leaving.
Your kneeling on the floor to pull the rug up gave you a good view inside the oven. There you find something called a goon guide. But you can't use it, because you're too good to be a goon. That's how it works, right? Or maybe not...
